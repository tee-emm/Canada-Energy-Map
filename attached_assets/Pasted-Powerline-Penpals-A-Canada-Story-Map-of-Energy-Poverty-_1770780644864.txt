Powerline Penpals: A Canada Story Map of Energy Poverty

Format: Interactive story-map (web app) where each region is a “chapter” told through letters, with branching responses, a mini budget-tradeoff tool, and a shared impact meter that visualizes what you prioritized.

It's essentially a playable anthology: four to six short narrative experiences that are different, but connected by the same UI language and decision system.

The core loop
1) Choose a region on a stylized map of Canada

The map starts “cold” and muted.

Regions glow as you complete stories (or based on how stable/unstable your outcomes were).

2) Read a letter from a character in that region

You can keep the writing tight: 250–500 words per letter.

Each region has 2–3 letters that progress over time (early winter → deep winter → end-of-month).

3) Respond + act (branching)

Each letter gives you 2–3 decision layers:

Tone choice (empathy / practical / skeptical) → affects trust + how much the character shares next.

Action choice (what help is realistic) → affects the impact meter.

One follow-up question (what you want to learn) → unlocks a “context card” (costs, reliability, landlord control, etc.) without turning it into a lecture.

4) Make a Warmth Wallet micro-decision (budget simulator)

After the response, you get a small “money & energy reality” moment:

You have $X or Y kWh or “2 outage days”

You must pick tradeoffs (heat vs groceries vs transit vs phone data vs medication storage)

This changes the meter and modifies the next letter.

5) End-of-region summary + “stamp” on the map

You see:

What you prioritized (e.g., Safety > Affordability > Agency > Comfort)

A short reflection line from the character (based on your choices)

A “regional stamp” is added to your passport (collectible UI moment)

Your “Impact Meter” (the thing that makes it feel like an app)

Use 4 axes so it’s easy to understand and visually satisfying:

Warmth & Health (physical safety, heat, medical needs)

Reliability (outages, predictability, preparedness)

Affordability (bill stability, debt spiral risk)

Agency (control, dignity, ability to choose & advocate)

Design idea: the meter is a little thermometer/compass widget that subtly animates after each choice, and the map heat overlay changes too (your “Heat Map Stories” layer).

Region chapters (how to combine your 4 perspectives + make it feel pan-Canadian)

You can do 4 regions (simpler) or 6 regions (more map-y). Here’s a 4-chapter version that covers diverse realities without feeling like a textbook:

Chapter A — The North (Reliability)

Character: Teen in a remote community dealing with outages + limited options.
Signature mechanic twist: “Outage Events” interrupt the letter (screen flicker, offline mode UI).
Warmth Wallet prompt: “Food safety vs phone data vs backup power.”

Chapter B — Big City (Housing control)

Character: Urban renter in a drafty building with unpredictable heat and confusing charges.
Twist: “Landlord Constraint” tag appears on choices—some actions are blocked unless you build community leverage.
Warmth Wallet: “Pay bill / buy space heater / transit to work / groceries.”

Chapter C — Rural (Seasonal spikes)

Character: Senior on fixed income facing winter heating volatility and isolation.
Twist: “Pride & Independence” trust mechanic—too pushy too soon reduces sharing.
Warmth Wallet: “Heat one room / refill tank / medical appointment travel.”

Chapter D — Medically dependent household (Power = survival)

Character: Caregiver managing devices/med storage where outages are emergencies.
Twist: Preparedness builder—your choices assemble a small “go-bag” checklist UI.
Warmth Wallet: “Battery backup / groceries / rent / medication cooling plan.”

If you want a 6-region map, you can split “Big City” into two (e.g., one about newcomers + billing confusion, one about high-rise landlord issues), and split “Rural” into “Prairies winter” vs “Atlantic older housing stock.”

The “letters” presentation (graphic design gold)

Make each region feel distinct through stationery systems:

Region-specific paper texture + stamp (but consistent layout grid)

Tiny icon language per region (snowflake, apartment key, fuel gauge, medical cross)

A “postmark date” for each letter (“Week 1 / Week 3 / Week 4”)

Optional: faint “map coordinates” watermark behind the text for cohesion

This is where your writing + art direction shines without needing huge illustrations.

Interaction + UX details that make it feel premium

Branch preview dots (subtle): show there are other paths without spoiling outcomes.

Trust meter is hidden until letter 2 (nice reveal).

Glossary tooltips are optional (“what is a delivery surcharge?”, “what is an outage alert?”) so it stays approachable.

Accessibility-first: keyboard navigation, reduced motion toggle, high-contrast mode, readable typography.

Ending summary:

After completing all regions:

A single “What you prioritized across Canada” dashboard

A map showing where outcomes were strongest/weakest

A short closing “letter to you” that changes based on your meter profile (this is super memorable)

Optional but powerful: a “Send a reply” final screen where the user writes 2–3 sentences (stored locally). That turns it into participation rather than consumption.
